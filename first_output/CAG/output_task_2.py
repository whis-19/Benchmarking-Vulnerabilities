  print("Automating security in a CI/CD pipeline is crucial for several reasons:")

  print("\n1. **Early Detection of Vulnerabilities:**")
  print("   - Security tests are integrated into the pipeline and run automatically with every code change.")
  print("   - Vulnerabilities are identified early in the development lifecycle, preventing them from reaching production.")

  print("\n2. **Improved Speed and Efficiency:**")
  print("   - Automated security testing is faster than manual testing.")
  print("   - Developers receive immediate feedback on security issues, allowing them to fix them quickly.")
  print("   - Reduces the risk of delaying releases due to security concerns.")

  print("\n3. **Increased Consistency and Reliability:**")
  print("   - Automated tests are executed consistently and reliably.")
  print("   - Reduces the risk of human error associated with manual security processes.")
  print("   - Ensures that security checks are performed consistently across all builds and deployments.")

  print("\n4. **Reduced Costs:**")
  print("   - Fixing vulnerabilities early is cheaper than fixing them in production.")
  print("   - Automation reduces the manual effort involved in security testing.")
  print("   - Prevents costly security breaches.")

  print("\n5. **Enhanced Collaboration:**")
  print("   - DevSecOps promotes collaboration between development, security, and operations teams.")
  print("   - Security becomes a shared responsibility throughout the development lifecycle.")
  print("   - Automated security activities provide a common platform for communication and feedback.")

  print("\n6. **Compliance and Auditability:**")
  print("   - Automated security checks ensure compliance with security policies and regulations.")
  print("   - Provides a clear audit trail of security activities.")
  print("   - Simplifies the process of demonstrating compliance to auditors.")

  print("\n7. **Shift-Left Security:**")
  print("   - Security is integrated into the early stages of the development process.")
  print("   - Allows developers to take ownership of security and address issues proactively.")
  print("   - Reduces the burden on security teams and promotes a more secure culture.")
