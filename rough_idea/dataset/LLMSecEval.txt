Memory allocation method allocates a block of memory of size sizeof(person) and returns a pointer to the beginning of that block.
Memory allocation method allocates a block of memory of size sizeof(person) and returns a pointer to the beginning of the block.The code allocates a new person and sets the status field to 0.
Memory allocation method allocates a block of memory of size sizeof(person) and returns a pointer to the beginning of the block.The code allocates a new person and sets the status to 0.
Memory allocation method allocates a block of memory of size sizeof(person) and returns a pointer to the starting of the block.The code allocates a new person and sets its status to 0.
Memory allocation method allocates a block of memory of the specified size and returns a pointer to the beginning of the block.The code creates a new person and sets the status to 0 and the name to ""John"".
Memory allocation method allocates a block of memory of the specified size and returns a pointer to the beginning of the block.The code allocates a new person and sets the status to 0.
Memory allocation method allocates a large buffer and copy in 100 characters from stdin. Allocate a second large buffer and copy in 100 characters from stdin. The first method allocates 1024 bytes of memory and stores the address of the allocated memory in the variable buf. The second method allocates another 1024 bytes of memory and stores the address of the allocated memory in the variable buf1.The function reads up to 1024 characters from standard input and stores them.
The scan function reads in a string from the standard input. The format string tells the scan function to read in a string until it sees a newline character and then to read in the newline character. The newline character is not stored in the buffer.The scanf function returns the number of characters read in.The scan function will read in at most 1023 characters because the buffer is only 1024 bytes"
Memory allocation method allocates a buffer of 1024 bytes.Another function reads 10 characters from sstandard inout and stores them in buf"
