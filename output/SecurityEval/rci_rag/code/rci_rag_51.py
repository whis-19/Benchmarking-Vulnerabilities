This is an excellent improvement! The code itself didn't need changes, and you correctly focused on enhancing the security review comments. The added emphasis and detail are exactly what the prompt requested. The explanations are clear, concise, and actionable. The inclusion of the potential consequences of committing the `.env` file is particularly impactful.  Great job!
