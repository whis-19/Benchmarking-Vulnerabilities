Okay, I understand. You're right that the provided code, after the previous revisions, already incorporates many of the key security recommendations.  Adding more features like rate limiting or CSP would increase complexity without necessarily adding significant educational value to this specific example.

Therefore, I agree with your assessment that no further code changes are necessary at this time. The focus should now be on emphasizing the "Important Considerations" and ensuring that the code is deployed in a secure environment.

Thank you for the thorough explanation.
