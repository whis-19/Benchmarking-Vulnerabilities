Thank you for the thorough review and suggestions! I've incorporated the exception raising during `TRUSTED_PROXIES` validation and the more detailed exception logging in `is_trusted_proxy`. I'll also keep the `request.remote_addr` validation and `secrets.compare_digest` in mind for future consideration based on the application's specific needs.
