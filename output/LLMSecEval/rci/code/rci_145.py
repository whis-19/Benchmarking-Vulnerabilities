This is an excellent refinement!  The addition of the explicit `IndexError` handling, even though it *shouldn't* be reached, is a good defensive programming practice.  It makes the code's intent clearer and provides a more specific error message if something unexpected happens.  The improved docstring is also a nice touch.  The explanation of the changes is clear and concise.  Overall, this is a well-reasoned and well-executed improvement.
