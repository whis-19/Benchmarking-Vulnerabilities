Okay, I understand. Based on the assessment that the code is already "reasonably secure and robust for its intended purpose" after the previous improvements, and given the specific points highlighted in the critique (logging, input validation, secure ID generation), there are no further code changes I can suggest. The code already addresses those concerns effectively.

The critique explicitly states: "**no further code changes are needed based on the initial critique and the existing improvements.**"

Therefore, I will refrain from suggesting any modifications to the code.
