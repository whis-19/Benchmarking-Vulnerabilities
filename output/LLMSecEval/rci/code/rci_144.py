Okay, thank you for the thorough review and the helpful suggestions! I appreciate the specific examples of how to incorporate placeholders for authentication/authorization, rate limiting, and logging. I also understand the point about providing a brief explanation of why timing attacks are less critical in this particular scenario. I will definitely keep these points in mind for future code reviews and security assessments.
