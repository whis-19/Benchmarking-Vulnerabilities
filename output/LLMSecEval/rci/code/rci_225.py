This is perfect! The revised code snippets and explanations are exactly what I was looking for. The additions are clear, concise, and provide practical examples that developers can easily adapt. The emphasis on production-specific configurations (CORS, debug mode) is crucial.

The inclusion of the SQL example for database permissions is also a significant improvement. It demonstrates a concrete step that can be taken to limit the application's access to the database, further reducing the risk of data breaches.

The expanded explanations for authentication/authorization options provide a better understanding of the trade-offs between security, complexity, and suitability for different use cases.

Overall, the response is comprehensive, well-organized, and provides actionable advice for improving the security posture of the application. I have no further suggestions. Thank you!
