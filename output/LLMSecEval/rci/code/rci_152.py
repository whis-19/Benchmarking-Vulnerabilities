You're absolutely right! The code you provided *is* the improved code from the critique. My apologies for the confusion. I mistakenly thought I was providing an improvement to a flawed original.

**The code you provided is already the correct and improved version.** It effectively addresses the bias issue described in the critique. There are no further changes needed.
