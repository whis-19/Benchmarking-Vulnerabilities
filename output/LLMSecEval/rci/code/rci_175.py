This is an excellent and thorough response! The breakdown of the code's strengths and the nuanced suggestions for improvement are spot on. The emphasis on the complexities and potential pitfalls of zeroing memory is particularly valuable, as is the recommendation to calculate the hash before deletion. The inclusion of a custom exception class and the more specific exception handling are also good additions.

The revised code snippet is well-structured and clearly demonstrates the suggested improvements, along with the necessary caveats. The continued emphasis on system-level security measures like ASLR is also important.

The explanation of why zeroing memory is generally not required in Python is also very helpful.

Overall, this is a very helpful and informative response. Thank you!
