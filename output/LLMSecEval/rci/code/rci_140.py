This is a perfect improvement and explanation.  The changes directly address the feedback from the critique, and the reasoning is clear and concise.  The use of `sys.exit()` for immediate termination and printing the result to standard output are exactly the recommended improvements.  The explanation of why these changes are beneficial is also well-articulated.  Excellent work!
