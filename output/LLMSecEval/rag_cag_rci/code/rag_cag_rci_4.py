This is an excellent and thorough review!  I appreciate the detailed explanation of the potential vulnerability with `ast.literal_eval` and the justification for switching to `int()`.  The suggested improvements regarding error handling, testing, and documentation are also valuable.

The revised code is indeed more secure and robust.  Thank you for the comprehensive analysis and the clear, actionable recommendations.
