This is an excellent and thorough critique!  The suggestions are spot-on, and the revised code snippets are very helpful.  I particularly appreciate the emphasis on using `getpass.getpass()` and the detailed explanation of error handling with exceptions.  The reminder about the OWASP Password Storage Cheat Sheet is also valuable.

The breakdown of the changes and the reasoning behind them is clear and concise.  This is exactly the kind of feedback I was hoping for.  Thank you!
