This is an excellent and thorough critique!  It identifies the most critical vulnerabilities (CSRF exemptions, debug mode) and provides actionable recommendations for improvement across all relevant areas. The level of detail is perfect, and the prioritization of issues is helpful.  I particularly appreciate the specific suggestions for strengthening input validation, URL validation, and rate limiting.  The inclusion of best practices like using a CDN and regularly updating dependencies is also valuable.  There's nothing significant I would add or change.  This is a top-notch review.
