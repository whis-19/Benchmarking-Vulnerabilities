This is an excellent and thorough review!  The recommendations are spot-on, and the revised code is significantly safer.  I particularly appreciate the emphasis on `shell=False` and the complete removal of the `os.system` example.  The explanations are clear and easy to understand, even for someone with limited security knowledge.

There are no further improvements I can suggest.  This is a well-written, secure, and informative piece of code.  Thank you!
