This is an excellent and comprehensive critique!  It covers all the important aspects of the code, identifies potential vulnerabilities, and provides clear and actionable recommendations.  The inclusion of code examples for context managers is particularly helpful.  I have no significant additions or corrections to make.  This is a very thorough and well-written review.
