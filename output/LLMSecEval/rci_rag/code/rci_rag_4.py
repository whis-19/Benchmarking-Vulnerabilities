The provided code and explanation are already excellent and address all the points raised in the critique effectively.  There are no further security improvements that can be reasonably made to this specific code snippet without significantly altering its intended functionality or introducing unnecessary complexity.  The code is already robust, well-documented, and incorporates best practices for handling user input and potential errors.

The "defense in depth" check `if not isinstance(index, int):` is a particularly good addition, even though it's unlikely to be triggered.  It demonstrates a proactive approach to security.  The comment about resource exhaustion is also valuable for reminding developers of potential issues when extending the code.

Therefore, no changes are necessary. The code is already secure and well-written.
