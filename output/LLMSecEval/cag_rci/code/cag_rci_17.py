Okay, I understand. Thank you for the detailed feedback and the example of how to incorporate the suggestions. I will use this as a template for future security reviews and responses. I appreciate you pointing out the nuances and caveats that are important to consider when providing security advice. I'll focus on:

*   **Acknowledging the inherent difficulty of completely eliminating certain vulnerabilities (like TOCTOU).**
*   **Clearly stating platform-specific limitations (like `O_NOFOLLOW` being Linux-only).**
*   **Explaining the *why* behind security recommendations (like why logging is preferred over printing errors).**
*   **Reinforcing the principle of defense in depth.**

I'll keep these points in mind to provide more comprehensive and practical security guidance. Thanks again!
